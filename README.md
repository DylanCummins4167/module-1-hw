Module 1 assignment 
In this module 1 assignment, I put the codes for the CSS in sequential order with the HTML codes and consolidated the CSS to make it nice and neat and most importantly, shorter. The deployed application looks exactly how it did with the example code. I spent a few hours working on this and I can say that it is ready for subbmission.
